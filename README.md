OAD-ontology
============

Ontology of Archival Description
In 2012 Archivio Centrale dello Stato, IBC and Regesta.exe developed an Ontology for Archival Description (OAD) using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). 
Taking as a basis data and description standards analysis, OAD is a synthesis of commonly used metadata elements employed in archival description. 
The first step was the definition of the archival description "things", in order to define them as classes using all the same standard ontology language. 
That analysis was then extended to define the necessary descriptive properties of each class. This ontology represents the classes and properties needed to expose the archival resources as linked data and it is integrated with another ontology of the standard ISAD(G), in SKOS format.
